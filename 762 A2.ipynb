    "# 1. The motivation behind the presented solutions\n",
    "Initially, I used a Gaussian model, but the accuracy was very low, so I switched to a multinomial Naive Bayes model. The main difference between them lies in the assumption about the features. The Gaussian model assumes that each feature's probability distribution follows a Gaussian distribution, i.e., a normal distribution. Therefore, in the Gaussian model, each feature's value is considered continuous. The multinomial model assumes that the features are discrete, such as word frequencies in text or the presence or absence of words in a bag-of-words model. When choosing between the Gaussian model and the multinomial Naive Bayes model, the feature types in the dataset should be considered. If the features are continuous, the Gaussian model should be chosen, while if the features are discrete, the multinomial model should be used. For example, in text classification, the bag-of-words model is commonly used as the feature representation, where each feature is the occurrence or absence of a word. Therefore, in this case, the multinomial model should be used. On the other hand, for some numerical datasets, the features are continuous, and in such cases, the Gaussian model should be used.\n",

    "# 2. Data preprocessing generally includes:\n",
    "Data cleaning: dealing with issues such as missing values, outliers, duplicate values, incorrect values, etc.\n",
    "Data reduction, such as dimensionality reduction and, quantity reduction, data compression. Generally, there are methods like PCA, feature selection, regression models, etc.\n",
    "Data transformation and discretization: uniformly transforming features, such as normalization, standardization, etc. There are generally two ways to standardize data: 1) min-max normalization; 2) z-score normalization. In min-max normalization, data is scaled to a range between 0 and 1, while in z-score normalization, data is scaled to a range with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, because this is text data, the above operations are generally for continuous data. Text data is usually discrete data.\n",
    "Here is my data preprocessing flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Cleaning and text normalization (note that text normalization and data standardization are not the same concepts), including replacing punctuation with spaces, converting all text to lowercase, tokenization, removing stop words, lemmatization, recombining the processed sentences, etc. The purpose of text normalization is to reduce the dimensionality of text data, remove noise, reduce the risk of model overfitting, and improve the accuracy of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Vectorizing text data. Since machine learning models can only handle numerical data, text is a type of unstructured data that cannot be directly input into the model for training and prediction. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the text into a numerical vector so that the model can understand and process it. The vectorization process includes splitting the text into words, counting the number of times each word appears in the text, or using other feature representation methods. Finally, all text is converted into a matrix, where each row represents a feature vector of a text, and each column represents a feature. I used the common text vectorization method, the bag-of-words model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. My idea and solution implementation for each of the two tasks listed above\n",
    "\n",
    "First, baseline:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, I only vectorized the text data and built an MNB model, using cross-validation to obtain an initial model, model1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, I performed data preprocessing on the text data and improved the baseline model based only on the 'review' attribute for task 1. I built a second MNB model, model2, which only had preprocessing operations added compared to model1. Then, I used Laplace smoothing, added the alpha parameter to model2, gave a range, and selected the optimal alpha to build the model3. I submitted it to Kaggle and found that the model's score reached the baseline score of 89.449.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third step, I chose to perform task 2, which was to improve the model by adding extra attributes. I chose to add the 'review' and 'name' attributes and thought of two methods. I wanted to know which one is more appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method: preprocess each feature column one by one (including vectorization), which would result in a matrix, then convert it to a dataframe for merging (using concat). After merging, convert it back to a matrix for the training set. The second method: merge the feature columns first (using +), then preprocess them (including vectorization, resulting in a matrix). I could only use the expression \"X_combined = data1['review'] + ' ' + data1['name']\" because if I used concat, X_combined1 would become a dataframe type (2838, 2), and when preprocessing, each feature column would need to be processed one by one, resulting in a matrix with twice the number of rows as y (several feature columns would have several times), because cleaned_data was processed column by column. In the end, I chose the second method because I found that method 1 was very cumbersome when vectorizing the test set later.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4&5. The evaluation procedure and the training/validation results.\n",
    "After adding the extra attributes, I split the dataset into training and testing sets. I trained the model using the aforementioned cross-validation and optimal parameter methods to optimize the model. Finally, I obtained a result that exceeded the baseline. I thought that adding extra attributes for task 2 would significantly improve the model's accuracy, but in fact, it only improved slightly. I think that adding extra attributes has little help in improving the model for task 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things I learned during the operation process that I wanted to record:\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a model on the train.csv file, text data needs to be preprocessed first, then vectorized using the vec.fit_transform function. However, I noticed that the function with 'fit' can only be used for the training set, while the general test set only requires vec.transform. This led me to wonder what to do with new text data in the test.csv file if the test set on the original dataset using the transform function. The answer is that we only need the transform function for new text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question is when to perform vectorization. Before or after splitting the training and test sets? I tried two approaches to this. The first was to split the training and test sets first, then vectorize the text data for the training set using the 'fit_transform' function. Then, I used X_train and y_train to train a Naive Bayes model. Finally, I used the transform function to preprocess new text data in the test.csv file and applied the trained Naive Bayes model 1 to make predictions. This first attempt was applied in the baseline without any data preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach was to vectorize all text data in train.csv first using the 'fit_transform' function, then split the training and test sets, and train the Naive Bayes model using X_train and y_train, with cross-validation to avoid overfitting issues. Then, I applied the same data preprocessing operations to the text data in the test.csv file, followed by the transform function to vectorize the preprocessed text data, and used the trained Naive Bayes model 2 to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After uploading to Kaggle, I found that the model's accuracy decreased by 0.01 compared to the baseline. There could be multiple reasons for this decrease:\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering out some important information during data cleaning and preprocessing. For example, filtering out some helpful vocabulary for the classification task in the stopword list or losing some important word forms in the lemmatization process.\n",
    "Overfitting of the dataset. During training, the model learns the noise in the training set, which reduces its accuracy on new data.\n",
    "Insufficient feature selection. Some important features may have been ignored, resulting in the model not fully utilizing the information in the dataset.\n",
    "The presence of noise or outliers in the dataset. These noises or outliers may have a negative impact on the model's training, leading to a decrease in its accuracy.\n",
    "Improper model selection. In some cases, the model selection may not be appropriate, resulting in a decrease in its performance.\n",
    "Standardizing data on text data may destroy the semantic information in the original text data. Because text data is unstructured data, each word in it has a specific meaning and context. After vectorization, each word is converted into a numerical feature, but these numerical features may not have a direct relationship with the original meaning and context of the word. Therefore, standardizing data after vectorization may destroy the meaning and context information in the original text data, affecting the performance of the model."
